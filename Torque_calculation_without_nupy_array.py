    Joints - Two types - Prismatic, Revolute we have only revolute joints here.
    system torque will provide the torque for both the joints tau1 and tau2.
    dh_table is the DH para,meters of our finger model.
    th1- Angle of first link from ground (between x0, x1)
    th2- Angle of 2nd link with respect to first link ( between x1,x2)
    a1-  First link length
    a2 - second link length
    th1dot - first joint angular velocity
    th2dot - second joint angular velocity
    m1 - mass of the first link
    m2 - mass of teh second link
    th1ddot - angular acceleration of the first joint
    th2ddot - angular acceleration of second joint
    ixx1, iyy1, izz1, ixy1, ixz1, iyz1 - inertia tensors of link 1
    ixx2, iyy2, izz2, ixy2, ixz2, iyz2 - inertia tensors of link 2
    dh_table = [ alpha, a, theta, d]
    alpha - link twist angle between zi-1 to zi along xi-1
    a - link lengths
    theta -  (joint angles) angle between xi to xi-1 along zi
    d - distances between xi and xi-1 along zi
    t - Total transformation matrix
    tdh - Transformation matrix of each joint frame
    x1, y1, z1 - location of center of mass of link 1
    x2, y2, z2 - location of center of mass of link 2
    we calculate DH parameters to get the relative information
    between 2 joints
