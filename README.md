# Dextrous_Antagonistic_robotic_finger
This is a project where I worked with 2 otehr students in case study that was a part of our curriculumn. In this project we have coded to show the optimum motion of the 2 link robot
as finger has 2 links so we can consider it as 2 link robot. Here we build the model using Newton's euler method kinematics equations to generate the trajectory and then used 
SQP(Non_linear optimization) technique to optimize the trajectory.
